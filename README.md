puppet-consul
=============

A Puppet module to install and start Consul

consul

This is the consul module.

# Why are you shipping the Consul binary files in the files directory?
## I don't know of any OS packages that I could use a package resource with. Also, they are each about 13MB which means that the whole module is still less than 60MB and there are no additional dependencies.
